# Data-Analyst-labs

Here are some of my data analysis labs. Below is a list of topics and a brief description for each laboratory:

1. Implementation of the Forel clustering algorithm
2. Selecting the best models and setting parameters for weather time series forecasting and housing price prediction
3. This laboratory has the same dataset as the second one, but here it was needed to use a perceptron to predict the values
4. Training clustering models and selection of the best one using the Adjusted Rand Index, Calinski-Harabasz Index, Davies- Bouldin index metrics.
5. Using the Adaboost ensemble model to predict values
6. Realization of feedforward neural network for image classification
